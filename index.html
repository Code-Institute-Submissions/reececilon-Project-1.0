                    <h3>Sparks Creativity</h3>
                    <p>When your mind is at peace, not distracted by the external world, and you are able to just observe the stars. Your creative mind takes over, and you are able to approach problems with a more creative outlook.</p>

                    <h3>Connects You to Nature</h3>
                    <p>Because of the light pollution from city lights, in order to see the nights sky, it is necessary that you go outdoors into nature away from bright city lights. Studies have shown that spending time with nature can improve mental health.</p>

                    <p>Mapping stars was once used as a way for sailors to find their way through the ocean. The sun was used by ancient egyptians to tell the time. Looking up at the nights sky has allowed our perspective of our own planet to change.</p>
