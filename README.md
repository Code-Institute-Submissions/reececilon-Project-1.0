# STARGAZING

Stargazing is a site that aims to inspire people to get out into nature and gaze at the stars whilst sharing the beautiful views with others. The club is appropriate for all age groups, all you need is a keen interest in watching the stars and other celestial bodies. Stargazing would be useful to those who have wanted to watch the stars but did not know when the best times or best places to look up are.
