- Navigation Bar
    - The navigation bar is fully responsive and provides links to all three pages of this site; the home page, the gallery page, and the sign up page. The site logo is also featured within the navigation bar. The navigation bar is identical on all three pages to allow easy navigation of the site.
    - The navigation bar is designed to fit with the theme of stargazing. With this in mind, each page navigation link will scale up in size when hovered over and when the page is active to relate to looking at something through a telescope to magnify it.
    - The logo is also designed to fit this theme. The logo has a simple camera frame border around it to resemble looking at something with a camera lens. 
    - This section allows for easy navition of the site without the use of the back button, whilst maintaining the stargazing theme.
